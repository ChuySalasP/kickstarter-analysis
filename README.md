### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

No enough goals if 20,000 or more. No cancelation in 1047 projects can be a error

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
	1. Project with goals over 15000 are too risk
	2. Project with goals under 5000 has better succesfuls percentages

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
	- We have no enough information to determinate a conclusion

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
	- Because Louise is almost done in her fundrasing, this can be considered an outdated data base

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
